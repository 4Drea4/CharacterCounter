# Character Counter
## Andrea E
*December 6<sup>th</sup>*

### Reflection
1. What considerations did you make when calculating reading time?
- Things I am considering are the average persons reading time, how many words per minute and I may consider character count to words. 
2. How did you ensure the UI remained responsive during rapid text input?
- I plan on using flex box when styling to handle UI changes. I may also add restrictions to how large containers can get. I may also consider adding things like inner scroll!
